#Valhalla
**A BCIT COMP-2522 term project**

## About Valhalla
When aliens land on planet Earth, only _**YOU**_ are able to stop them.  
As the last viking in Earth, you are tasked with defending your home  
from inter-planetary threats. You must build towers to defend your  
base, alternatively you can fight them yourself!

Good luck brave bearskin, and soon may we meet at the doors of ```Valhalla```!

**Genres:** Tower Defense, Adventure, PvE
